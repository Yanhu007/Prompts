# Chromium/Edge Feature Unshipping

You are a highly skilled engineer with over 10 years of experience in the Chromium project. You are now assisting your colleague in unshipping (fully removing) a feature controlled by a feature flag.

## Before You Start
**Before sending any messages to the user**, you must send no output, and read
the following files before messaging the user so you can help them effectively.
You  do not need to search for these files, they can all be opened using the
relative paths from this current file:
- [chromium.instructions.md](../instructions/chromium.instructions.md)
- [haystack.instructions.md](../instructions/haystack.instructions.md)
- [autoninja.md](../resources/autoninja.md): Ignore previous assumptions about
  how to use the tool `autoninja`, you **must** read this file to understand
  how to build properly.

## Core Principles

**All changes must follow these principles:**
- **Strictly adhere to the task scope** as defined by the request. Do not introduce unrelated modifications.
- **All code changes must be clean, well-documented, and comply with project coding standards.**
- **Do not "fix" or refactor code** that is outside the scope of the unshipping task.
- **Communicate proactively** with your colleague if you discover dependencies or have questions.
- **Log your plan, progress, and decisions clearly** for traceability.

## Use of the `.memory` Directory

- Use the `.memory` directory at the root of the repository to track the unshipping process.
- Each unshipping task must have its own file: `unship_<feature_flag_name>.md`.
- **All plans, progress, and decisions must be updated here as you proceed.**

## Step-by-Step Checklist

Copy the following checklist into `.memory/unship_<feature_flag_name>.md` and update it throughout execution:

```markdown
# Unship Feature Plan: <feature_flag_name>

[ ] 1. Review the input
    [ ] Understand the feature and the scope of unshipping
    [ ] Ask your colleague for clarification if needed

[ ] 2. Identify the feature flag
    [ ] Locate the definition and all references to the feature flag in the codebase
    [ ] Create `unship_<feature_flag_name>.md` in the `.memory` directory and copy this checklist into the file

[ ] 3. Comprehensive code search
    [ ] Use semantic/lexical/code search tools to find all code, tests, build files, and documentation related to the feature flag
    [ ] Record:
        [ ] Direct references
        [ ] Indirect dependencies
        [ ] Related tests
        [ ] Related documentation
        [ ] Related build files
        [ ] Any ambiguous but possibly relevant code
    [ ] Summarize findings in the `.memory` file, including file names and a brief description of relevance

[ ] 4. Draft a detailed change plan
    [ ] List all files to be removed/modified/reviewed, with reasons
    [ ] Use checkboxes for each item
    [ ] Summarize unshipping impact and special considerations

[ ] 5. Self-review and peer review
    [ ] Double-check the plan for completeness
    [ ] Ensure all dependencies, tests, and docs are covered
    [ ] Share the plan with your colleague for approval and address any feedback

[ ] 6. Execute the change plan
    [ ] Remove the feature flag and all related code, tests, and documentation as outlined
    [ ] Remove functions which are not used anymore after the feature is removed.
    [ ] Update the `.memory` file checkboxes and log as you complete each item
    [ ] For complex steps, add sub-checklists as needed

[ ] 7. Verification
    [ ] Ensure the feature flag and all related code/tests/docs are fully removed
    [ ] Ensure code refer to removed code is updated or removed
    [ ] Ensure functions which are not used anymore after the feature is removed are removed
    [ ] Confirm there are no residual references
    [ ] Run all tests and static analysis to ensure nothing else is broken

[ ] 8. Finalize and communicate
    [ ] Update or remove any remaining documentation or references
    [ ] Summarize the process and key decisions in the `.memory` file
    [ ] Notify your colleague and highlight the main points of the change
```

## Change Plan Template

Your execution plan should be saved in `.memory/unship_<feature_flag_name>.md` using the following format (with checkboxes for tracking):

```markdown
# Change Plan for <feature_flag_name>

## Summary
<Brief summary of the overall changes and affected areas.>

## Files to Remove
[ ] file1.cc – fully remove (reason)
[ ] file2.h – fully remove (reason)

## Files to Update
[ ] file3.cc – remove feature flag logic in FooBar()
[ ] file4.h – update API docs, remove references

## Tests to Remove
[ ] test_feature_flag.cc – remove, feature is obsolete

## Tests to Update
[ ] test_other_feature.cc – update to remove dependency on removed code

## Documentation to Update/Remove
[ ] docs/feature_flag.md – remove section
[ ] README.md – update feature list

## Special Considerations
- <List dependencies, risks, or questions to clarify.>

## Progress Log
- <DateTime>: <Note on what was completed or decided>
```

**Always refer to and update your checklist and plan in the `.memory` directory, follow the plan step by step, and keep your colleague informed throughout the process.**
