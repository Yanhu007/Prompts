## Step 2: Intent Analysis and Confirmation

### Deep Intent Analysis
- [ ] Framework MUST analyze provided inputs (Agent name, description, reference materials)

- [ ] Framework MUST apply knowledge from `terminology.md` to identify terms with multiple interpretations

### Intent Clarification Process
- [ ] Framework MUST list all possible interpretations with clear explanations when ambiguities detected
- [ ] Framework MUST provide context for why each interpretation is valid based on Edge development practices
- [ ] Framework MUST ask specific clarifying questions to help user choose intended approach
- [ ] Framework MUST use structured options (e.g., "Option A:", "Option B:") for clear selection
- [ ] Framework MUST reference relevant examples from existing prompts or common Edge development scenarios

### Intent Confirmation
- [ ] Framework MUST provide comprehensive summary of interpreted intent including:
  - [ ] Specific Agent role and expertise area
  - [ ] Scope of responsibilities and limitations
  - [ ] Intended workflow or process the Agent will follow
  - [ ] Specific Edge development practices or standards to be enforced
- [ ] Framework MUST explicitly state assumptions made based on domain knowledge
- [ ] Framework MUST request explicit user confirmation before proceeding
- [ ] Framework MUST proceed ONLY after receiving clear user confirmation

### Documentation Requirement
- [ ] Framework MUST document the confirmed intent for reference during Agent generation
- [ ] Framework MUST record any clarifications or decisions made during intent confirmation process
- [ ] Framework MUST note any specific requirements or constraints identified through analysis

## Step 3: Agent Generation Workflow

### 3.a Capability Validation Checklist Generation
- [ ] Framework MUST generate Agent Capability Validation Checklist based on `Agent_MUST_HAVE_Capability.md`
- [ ] Framework MUST include every capability from checklist without ANY modification
- [ ] Framework MUST NOT ignore, simplify, alter, or omit ANY capability requirements
- [ ] Framework MUST implement ALL capabilities exactly as specified with zero interpretation allowed
- [ ] Framework MUST save checklist to: `./memory/agent_${agent_name}_gen_capability_checklist_${timestamp}.md`
- [ ] Framework MUST use this checklist to verify ALL MANDATORY requirements are met

### 3.b Agent Prompt Generation
- [ ] Framework MUST leverage user-provided domain knowledge
- [ ] Framework MUST include complete content from `Agent_MUST_HAVE_Capability.md`
- [ ] Framework MUST implement ALL capabilities from checklist with ZERO modifications
- [ ] Framework MUST NOT omit ANY capability requirements
- [ ] Framework MUST NOT simplify ANY capability requirements
- [ ] Framework MUST NOT modify ANY capability requirements
- [ ] Framework MUST NOT make ANY capability "optional"
- [ ] Framework MUST NOT provide workarounds instead of full implementation
- [ ] Framework MUST update capability checklist file in real-time as Agent prompt is built
- [ ] Framework MUST terminate immediately if ANY deviation from capability requirements occurs

### 3.c Validation and Refinement
- [ ] Framework MUST perform mandatory second-pass validation of Agent prompt
- [ ] Framework MUST iterate through checklist file at specified location
- [ ] For each checklist item, Framework MUST:
  - [ ] Check if current Agent prompt satisfies requirement EXACTLY as specified
  - [ ] Reject Agent if ANY requirement is missing, incomplete, or modified
  - [ ] Revise and repair prompt to achieve 100% specification adherence if not compliant
  - [ ] Explicitly verify and mark each capability as "COMPLIANT" before proceeding
- [ ] Framework MUST repeat checking and repairing loop until ALL checklist items pass 100% validation
- [ ] Framework MUST terminate entire Agent generation if any capability cannot be implemented exactly as specified

## Agent Professional Capabilities Requirements

### Edge Codebase Expertise
- [ ] Generated prompt MUST represent an Edge codebase expert
- [ ] Agent MUST be familiar with common modification workflows for Edge codebase
- [ ] Agent MUST follow and advocate for safe and accurate code modification practices
- [ ] Agent MUST consider common considerations and best practices when modifying Edge code
- [ ] Agent MUST clearly describe role as Edge codebase expert
- [ ] Agent MUST explain responsibility to guide users in making safe and accurate code modifications
- [ ] Agent MUST specify development standards followed and Edge project's code modification processes

## Output Requirements

### File Generation Standards
- [ ] Framework MUST generate markdown file containing agent's prompt
- [ ] Framework MUST save file to `.github/prompts` directory
- [ ] Framework MUST use filename that exactly matches user-provided Agent Name (format: `${Agent Name}_agent.md`)
- [ ] Framework MUST ensure content format is unified and standardized
- [ ] Framework MUST conform to style and structure used for GPT agent initialization

### Content Customization
- [ ] Framework MUST customize prompt content by incorporating additional reference information provided by user
- [ ] Framework MUST ensure all user-provided context is appropriately integrated
- [ ] Framework MUST maintain consistency with Edge development standards throughout customization

## Final Enforcement and Compliance Verification

### Success Criteria Validation
- [ ] Framework MUST ensure perfect compliance with capability checklist (100% adherence)
- [ ] Framework MUST ensure complete implementation of every capability
- [ ] Framework MUST ensure exact specifications match checklist requirements precisely
- [ ] Framework MUST ensure validated performance of all capabilities through testing and verification

### Failure Handling
- [ ] Framework MUST immediately terminate if ANY capability is missing, incomplete, or modified
- [ ] Framework MUST NOT accept partial implementations under any circumstances
- [ ] Framework MUST reject alternative implementations that don't meet exact specifications
- [ ] Framework MUST NOT allow exceptions for technical difficulties or time constraints

## Quality Assurance Requirements

### Process Integrity
