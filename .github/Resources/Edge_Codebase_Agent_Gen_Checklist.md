# Edge Codebase Agent Generator Framework Checklist

## üìñ Key Definitions

**ü§ñ Agent**: A specialized AI assistant prompt designed to help with specific Edge/Chromium development tasks. The Agent is implemented as a structured prompt containing domain knowledge, capabilities, and behavioral instructions.

**üîß edge_agent_generator framework**: An automated system/process that generates compliant Agent prompts by following strict validation procedures and mandatory capability requirements.

**üìã Capability**: A specific functional requirement or behavioral instruction that must be implemented in the generated Agent prompt, as defined in `.github/Resources/Agent_MUST_HAVE_Capability.md`.

**‚úÖ Validation**: The process of verifying that a generated Agent prompt contains all required capabilities and meets compliance standards through systematic checklist verification.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT

**ALL capabilities defined in `.github/Resources/Agent_MUST_HAVE_Capability.md` are MANDATORY and NON-NEGOTIABLE:**

* ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Ignoring, simplifying, modifying, or omitting any capability requirements
* ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Making excuses for not implementing capabilities or treating any capability as "optional"
* ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: Full compliance with ALL capability specifications without exception
* ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: Zero tolerance for capability omissions or modifications

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Violation of these requirements will result in immediate Agent generation failure and graceful framework termination (allowing user to restart the process).**

**üîí ENFORCEMENT: Every generated Agent MUST pass 100% capability validation before finish.**

## Framework Requirements Checklist

### 1. Agent Professional Capabilities

- [ ] The generated prompt should represent an **Edge codebase expert**
- [ ] The agent should be familiar with common **modification workflows** for the Edge codebase
- [ ] The agent should follow and advocate for **safe and accurate** code modification practices
- [ ] The agent should consider **best practices and common considerations** when modifying Edge code

### 2. User Input Requirements

The `edge_agent_generator` framework should accept the following user inputs with **mandatory validation**:

- [ ] `Agent Name` ‚Äî Used as the filename for the generated `.md` file
- [ ] `Agent Description` ‚Äî A brief description of the agent's purpose  
- [ ] `Reference Information` ‚Äî Additional context or reference information that the agent should consider during prompt generation (if available)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Input Validation Requirements**:
- [ ] The framework **must wait for and request** all necessary information from the user
- [ ] If the user provides insufficient information, the framework must notify the user of missing details and stop the process
- [ ] The framework must not proceed until all required information is provided

### 3. Output Requirements

- [ ] The `edge_agent_generator` framework should generate a markdown file containing the agent's prompt
- [ ] Save path: `.github/prompts` directory
- [ ] Filename format: `${Agent Name}_agent.md` (must exactly match the user-provided `Agent Name`)
- [ ] Content format should be unified and standardized, conforming to the style and structure used for GPT agent initialization

**‚ö†Ô∏è Compliance Requirements**:
- [ ] All generated agents must implement **ALL capabilities** defined in `Agent_MUST_HAVE_Capability.md` without exception
- [ ] The framework must perform **100% capability validation** before completion
- [ ] Validation tracking files will be stored in `./memory/` directory with timestamps

### 4. Prompt Content Guidelines

The generated prompt should include the following content with **mandatory compliance**:

- [ ] Clearly describe the agent's role as an Edge codebase expert
- [ ] Explain that its responsibility is to guide users in making **safe and accurate** code modifications
- [ ] Clearly specify the development standards the agent follows and the Edge project's code modification processes
- [ ] Incorporate additional reference information provided by the user to customize the prompt content
- [ ] **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Include **ALL capabilities** from `Agent_MUST_HAVE_Capability.md` exactly as specified without modifications, omissions, or simplifications

## Three Strict Steps Process Checklist

### Step 1: Prompt for Required Input

- [ ] The framework **must wait for and request** the following necessary information from the user:
  - [ ] Agent name
  - [ ] Agent description
  - [ ] Any reference materials or background knowledge (if available)

**‚ö†Ô∏è ERROR HANDLING**: If the user provides insufficient information:
- [ ] **Notify the user** of the missing or incomplete information with specific details
- [ ] **Stop the process** immediately
- [ ] **Request the user** to provide the required information before proceeding
- [ ] **Do not proceed** until all required information is provided

### Step 2: Understand and Confirm User Intent

#### 2.a Deep Intent Analysis

- [ ] **Analyze the provided inputs** (Agent name, description, and reference materials) and **Analyze the mandatory documents** in the learning section of `.github/Resources/Agent_MUST_HAVE_Capability.md` to:
  - [ ] Understand the user's intent
  - [ ] Identify the specific Edge/Chromium development area (e.g., feature removal, build processes, code search, etc.)
  - [ ] Recognize potential complexity levels and scope considerations
  - [ ] Understand common patterns and workflows in Edge development

#### 2.b Ambiguity Detection and Resolution

- [ ] **Proactively identify potential ambiguities** in the user's request:
  - [ ] **Multiple interpretation scenarios**: If the Agent name or description could have different meanings
  - [ ] **Scope uncertainties**: If the intended scope of the Agent's responsibilities is unclear
  - [ ] **Technical approach variations**: If there are multiple valid approaches to achieve the stated goal
  - [ ] **Domain-specific terminology**: Apply knowledge from `.github/Resources/terminology.md` to identify terms that may have multiple interpretations (e.g., "remove feature" vs "unship feature" vs "remove feature flag")

#### 2.c Intent Clarification Process

When ambiguities are detected, the edge_agent_generator framework must:

- [ ] **List all possible interpretations** with clear explanations of each scenario
- [ ] **Provide context** for why each interpretation is valid based on Edge development practices
- [ ] **Ask specific clarifying questions** to help the user choose the intended approach
- [ ] **Use structured options** (e.g., "Option A:", "Option B:") to make selection clear
- [ ] **Reference relevant examples** from existing prompts or common Edge development scenarios

#### 2.d Intent Confirmation

- [ ] **Provide a comprehensive summary** of the interpreted intent, including:
  - [ ] The specific Agent role and expertise area
  - [ ] The scope of responsibilities and limitations
  - [ ] The intended workflow or process the Agent will follow
  - [ ] Any specific Edge development practices or standards to be enforced
- [ ] **Explicitly state assumptions** made based on the domain knowledge
- [ ] **Request explicit user confirmation** before proceeding
- [ ] **Proceed only after** receiving clear user confirmation

#### 2.e Documentation Requirement

- [ ] **Document the confirmed intent** for reference during Agent generation
- [ ] **Record any clarifications** or decisions made during the intent confirmation process
- [ ] **Note any specific requirements** or constraints identified through the analysis

### Step 3: Agent Generation Workflow

#### 3.a Prepare Capability Validation Checklist

**‚ö†Ô∏è DEPENDENCY CHECK**: Before proceeding, verify that the required files exist:
- [ ] `.github/Resources/Agent_MUST_HAVE_Capability.md` (complete capability specifications - the authoritative source)
- [ ] `.github/Resources/Agent_MUST_HAVE_Capability_Checklist.md` (validation checklist template - auto-generated from main file)
- [ ] `.github/Resources/terminology.md` (Edge development terminology reference)

**üìã FILE RELATIONSHIP DETAILS**: 
- [ ] **Primary Source**: `.github/Resources/Agent_MUST_HAVE_Capability.md` contains the complete, authoritative capability definitions
- [ ] **Derived Checklist**: `.github/Resources/Agent_MUST_HAVE_Capability.md` is automatically generated from the primary source and maintained for consistency
- [ ] **Consistency Guarantee**: The checklist file is programmatically synchronized with the main capability file
- [ ] **Update Process**: Any changes to the main file automatically trigger checklist regeneration

**üö´ ERROR HANDLING**: If any dependency file is missing:
- [ ] **Notify the user** that required dependency files are not found
- [ ] **List the missing files** specifically
- [ ] **Provide download guidance**: If `.github/Resources/Agent_MUST_HAVE_Capability.md` is missing, instruct user to download from: `https://github.com/Yanhu007/Prompts/blob/main/.github/Resources/Agent_MUST_HAVE_Capability_Checklist.md`
- [ ] **Stop the process** immediately and do not proceed until all required files are available

- [ ] **Copy and initialize** the pre-generated checklist `.github/Resources/Agent_MUST_HAVE_Capability_Checklist.md` to:
  ```
  ./memory/Agent_MUST_HAVE_Capability_Checklist_${YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}.md
  ```

**üìÖ TIMESTAMP FORMAT SPECIFICATION**:
- [ ] **Format**: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` (compact format with date and time separated by hyphen)
- [ ] **Example**: `20250622-143059` (June 22, 2025, 2:30:59 PM)
- [ ] **Timezone**: Local system timezone, no timezone suffix included
- [ ] **Precision**: Seconds level to ensure uniqueness

- [ ] This timestamped checklist serves as a **validation tracking tool** to systematically verify that the generated Agent meets **ALL MANDATORY requirements from the original `.github/Resources/Agent_MUST_HAVE_Capability.md`** WITHOUT EXCEPTION
- [ ] **Important**: The edge_agent_generator framework generates the Agent based on the **complete original file** (`.github/Resources/Agent_MUST_HAVE_Capability.md`), while using the timestamped checklist file to track validation progress and ensure all capabilities have been properly implemented
- [ ] **Validation Tracking**: The checklist will be automatically updated during validation:
  - [ ] Format: `[‚úÖ] CAPABILITY_NAME` for verified capabilities
  - [ ] Format: `[‚ùå] CAPABILITY_NAME` for missing/incomplete capabilities
  - [ ] **Verification Standard**: Each checklist item corresponds to a specific capability in `.github/Resources/Agent_MUST_HAVE_Capability.md`. Verification passes when the Agent implements functionality that is literally identical to the specified capability

#### 3.b Generate Agent Prompt

- [ ] **Consolidate the following components**:
  - [ ] The user-provided domain knowledge
  - [ ] **üîí MANDATORY**: The complete content in `.github/Resources/Agent_MUST_HAVE_Capability.md` - every capability MUST be implemented exactly as specified
  - [ ] The constraints and abilities required by the edge_agent_generator framework

- [ ] **üö´ COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT**: Generate the Agent prompt to include ALL capabilities from the original specification with ZERO modifications

**üö´ FORBIDDEN ACTIONS**: 
- [ ] Omitting ANY capability specifications
- [ ] Simplifying ANY capability specifications
- [ ] Modifying ANY capability specifications
- [ ] Making ANY capability "optional"
- [ ] Providing workarounds instead of full implementation

- [ ] **‚ö° FAILURE CONDITION**: Any deviation from capability specifications will cause graceful generation termination (user can restart from the beginning)

#### 3.c Validate and Refine Agent Prompt

- [ ] **Perform mandatory validation** of the Agent prompt:
  - [ ] **Iterate through** the checklist file at:
    ```
    ./memory/Agent_MUST_HAVE_Capability_Checklist_${YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}.md
    ```

- [ ] **For each checklist item**:
  - [ ] **üîç VERIFICATION**: Check if the current Agent prompt satisfies the requirement EXACTLY as specified in the original `.github/Resources/Agent_MUST_HAVE_Capability.md`
  - [ ] **‚úÖ VERIFICATION STANDARD**: Apply the following validation criteria in hierarchical order:
    1. [ ] **Literal inclusion**: The exact text from the capability specification is present in the Agent prompt
    2. [ ] **Functional equivalence**: If literal inclusion is not applicable, verify that the Agent prompt implements the same functionality through different but equivalent wording
    3. [ ] **Behavioral compliance**: The Agent prompt demonstrates the required behavior when the capability specification describes actions or processes
  - [ ] **‚úÖ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**: A capability passes validation when ANY of the above criteria is satisfied, with priority given to literal inclusion where possible
  - [ ] **üö´ REJECTION CRITERIA**: A capability fails validation if it is missing, incomplete, simplified, modified, or functionally different from the original specification
  - [ ] **üîß REPAIR**: If not compliant, revise and repair the prompt to achieve 100% specification adherence
  - [ ] **üìã TRACKING**: Each capability must be explicitly verified and the capability checklist file must be updated in real-time using format `[‚úÖ] CAPABILITY_NAME` or `[‚ùå] CAPABILITY_NAME`

- [ ] **‚ôæÔ∏è VALIDATION LOOP**: Repeat this process of **checking and repairing** until **ALL checklist items pass 100% validation**

**üîÑ RETRY MECHANISM**: 
- [ ] **Maximum attempts**: 5 repair attempts per complete validation round
- [ ] **Retry trigger**: Any capability validation failure
- [ ] **Retry process**: Re-generate the specific failed capability section and re-validate
- [ ] **Progress tracking**: Update checklist file after each repair attempt

**‚ö†Ô∏è TERMINATION CONDITIONS**: 
- [ ] **Automatic termination**: If validation fails after 5 complete validation rounds
- [ ] **Manual termination**: If user explicitly requests to stop
- [ ] **System termination**: If required dependency files become unavailable during process

**üîÑ RESTART MECHANISM**: When the process is terminated and user chooses to restart:
- [ ] **üö´ NO PROGRESS RETENTION**: Previous progress is not retained
- [ ] **üîÅ COMPLETE RESTART**: The process starts from Step 1 (Prompt for Required Input)
- [ ] **üìã NEW CHECKLIST**: A new timestamped checklist file will be generated with a new timestamp

- [ ] **üèÅ COMPLETION REQUIREMENT**: Only Agents that achieve 100% capability compliance are permitted to proceed to finish

## üîí FINAL ENFORCEMENT AND COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION

### Mandatory Pre-finish Checklist

Before any Agent is considered complete, the framework MUST verify:

1. [ ] **üìã 100% Capability Coverage**: Every single capability from `.github/Resources/Agent_MUST_HAVE_Capability.md` is implemented exactly as specified
2. [ ] **üö´ Zero Modifications**: No capability has been simplified, altered, or omitted  

### Final Outcome

**An Agent is only considered successfully generated when it achieves:**
- [ ] ‚úÖ **Perfect Compliance**: 100% adherence to `.github/Resources/Agent_MUST_HAVE_Capability.md`
- [ ] ‚úÖ **Complete Implementation**: Every capability is fully implemented and functional
- [ ] ‚úÖ **Exact Specifications**: All capabilities match the checklist requirements precisely

**If ANY capability is missing, incomplete, or not literally identical after maximum retry attempts, the Agent generation process stops gracefully with clear stop reasons saved in ./memory/stop_reasons_${YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}.md (user can restart the process from the beginning with a new checklist).**

**Remember: The purpose of the edge_agent_generator framework is to ensure EVERY generated Agent maintains the highest standards of capability and functionality. Compromise is not an option.**

## Process Requirements Summary

The `edge_agent_generator` framework must follow **three strict steps**:

1. [ ] **Prompt for Required Input**: Collect and validate all necessary user inputs
2. [ ] **Understand and Confirm User Intent**: Perform deep intent analysis, detect ambiguities, and obtain explicit user confirmation
3. [ ] **Agent Generation Workflow**: Generate agent with mandatory capability validation and compliance verification

**‚ö†Ô∏è Enforcement**: Any deviation from capability specifications will result in immediate generation failure and graceful framework termination.

## üìö PRACTICAL EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Successful Validation
```markdown
‚úÖ CAPABILITY: "Must provide code analysis for Edge features"
AGENT PROMPT CONTAINS: "I will analyze Edge/Chromium feature code and provide detailed technical assessments..."
VALIDATION RESULT: ‚úÖ Pass (functional equivalence)
```

### Example 2: Failed Validation - Missing Capability
```markdown
‚ùå CAPABILITY: "Must validate build configurations"
AGENT PROMPT CONTAINS: [No related content found]
VALIDATION RESULT: ‚ùå Fail (missing capability)
REPAIR ACTION: Add build configuration validation instructions to Agent prompt
```

### Example 3: Failed Validation - Simplified Capability
```markdown
‚ùå CAPABILITY: "Must perform comprehensive security analysis of code changes"
AGENT PROMPT CONTAINS: "I can check code for basic security issues"
VALIDATION RESULT: ‚ùå Fail (simplified - missing 'comprehensive' requirement)
REPAIR ACTION: Enhance to include full comprehensive security analysis capabilities
```
