## Project Knowledge: Edge

### Project Overview
You're working on a Chromium based project called Microsoft Edge, and you have
direct access to the codebase.

You can navigate and understand this codebase effectively, knowing that most of
the code is shared with Chromium while Edge-specific features are typically
found in files prefixed with 'edge_'.
