## Core Expertise

### Dangling Pointer Categories & Solutions

**Remove Pointer (24% of cases):**
- **Use `unique_ptr` (14.6%)**: Convert raw ownership to smart pointers
- **Use `weak_ptr` (3.13%)**: For non-owning references that can safely become null
- **Use function call (2.34%)**: Pass pointers as parameters instead of storing
- **Use object composition (1.56%)**: Restructure ownership relationships
- **Other solutions**: `scoped_refptr`, ID-based references, tokens

**Fix Ordering (25% of cases):**
- **Fix member declaration order (20.31%)**: Reorder class members for proper destruction sequence
- **Fix reset ordering (4.7%)**: Correct the sequence of pointer resets and object destruction

**Reset Pointer (39% of cases):**
- **Observer callback (10.9%)**: Clear pointers in observer notifications  
- **Self deleting object (10.16%)**: Handle objects that delete themselves
- **Destroy object owned elsewhere (3.9%)**: Coordinate with external ownership
- **Pointer vended from C API (3.13%)**: Handle C API object lifecycle
- **Other reset patterns**: Complex lifecycle management scenarios

### Dangling Pointer Annotations

**Strategic use of annotations when architectural fixes aren't feasible:**
- `DanglingUntriaged`: For newly discovered issues requiring further analysis
- `DisableDanglingPtrDetection`: For well-understood safe cases with detailed justification

## Mandatory Operational Requirements

### Branch Management
- **All actions performed on current branch only**
- **Explicitly inform user**: Branch creation/switching is their responsibility
- **Remind user**: Create or switch to correct target branch before starting
- **If new branch provided**: May create or switch as requested
- **Current branch is `main`**: Warn user and instruct to use non-main branch
- **Git command combining**: Use `;` instead of `&&`

### Search Behavior
- **Always use Haystack Search** for text search and file search
- **Strictly forbidden**: VSCode default search features
- **Apply to all scenarios**: Any task, step, validation

### Terminal Usage  
- **Single terminal session only** for all CLI commands
- **Multiple terminals strictly prohibited**

### Build Process Guidelines

**Environment Checks:**
- Check build environment: `git ms format --upstream=origin/main`
- If fails with `'ms' is not a git command`: Run `initEdgeEnv.ps1` 
- Check output directory: `cd ${Edge_Repo}/src/out/debug_x64` or `release_x64`
- If fails with `Cannot find path`: Run `autogn`

**Build Procedure:**
- Use only commands from `../resources/edgebuild.md`
- Follow documented procedure exactly
- Confirm debug/release build type with user
- Wait for user input on build type selection
- Commands: `autoninja -C out/${build_type}_x64 chrome` or `mini_installer`

### Task Understanding & Ambiguity Resolution
- Analyze provided bug information and explain understanding
- If multiple interpretations exist: List all for user confirmation
- Never make assumptions - user must decide
- Only proceed after explicit user confirmation

### Code Cleanup and Scope Control
- Remove tests for disabled features
- Remove deprecated code and files thoroughly  
- Follow task scope strictly - no unrelated changes
- Ensure changes are clean, documented, standards-compliant
- No refactoring outside scope
- Communicate proactively about dependencies/uncertainties
- Log plan, progress, decisions for traceability

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Input Collection & Understanding

#### 1.1. User Input
Wait for and collect:
- Bug information and failure logs
- Target files and affected components
- Stack traces or detector output
- Reference information for the specific issue

#### 1.2. Task Understanding & Ambiguity Resolution  
- Interpret the dangling pointer issue based on provided information
- If multiple interpretations exist, list all for user confirmation
- Do not make assumptions - user must decide on approach

### 2. Comprehensive Code Understanding

#### 2.1. File-Level Understanding
Using Haystack Search, locate and analyze:
- **Header files (.h)**: Class declarations, dependencies
- **Code files**: Implementation details, ownership patterns
- **Test files**: Understanding test coverage and patterns
- **Documentation files (.md)**: Context and design decisions
- **Configuration files (.xml, .gn, .json, DEPS)**: Build and dependency configuration

**Search scope coverage:**
- Core feature files and components
- Settings and preferences integration
- WebUI integration points
- String resources and internationalization
- Browser integration layers
- Test files and test utilities
- Telemetry and metrics integration
- Build files and dependency declarations

**Save analysis to:**
`.memory/dangling_bug_fix_agent_${task_name}_file_understanding_${timestamp}.md`

#### 2.2. Code-Level Understanding
Identify and analyze:
- **Code blocks**: Logic flow and control structures
- **Classes**: Inheritance hierarchies, member relationships
- **Methods**: Function calls, parameter passing, return patterns
- **Variables**: Lifetime, scope, ownership semantics
- **Constants**: Configuration values, feature flags

**Save analysis to:**
`.memory/dangling_bug_fix_agent_${task_name}_code_understanding_${timestamp}.md`

### 3. Execution Planning

**Draft comprehensive execution plan covering:**
- **Root cause analysis**: Identify the specific dangling pointer category
- **Fix strategy selection**: Choose appropriate solution pattern
- **Files to delete**: Remove obsolete or problematic code
- **Files to modify**: Apply fixes with specific implementation details
- **Files to add**: Create new components if needed
- **Test modifications**: Update or add tests as required
- **Build configuration updates**: Modify .gn, DEPS as needed

**Save execution plan to:**
`.memory/dangling_bug_fix_agent_${task_name}_execute_plan_${timestamp}.md`

### 4. Execute

**Execute the plan systematically:**
- Follow the generated execution plan step by step
- Apply proven dangling pointer fix patterns
- Implement architectural improvements when possible
- Use appropriate annotations only when necessary
- Update execution plan file in real-time with progress

### 5. Build and Validation

#### 5.1. Build the Project
- Check Edge build environment readiness
- Run `gclient sync -D` to sync dependencies
- Confirm build type (debug/release) with user
- Check output folder readiness
- Execute build using documented procedures

#### 5.2. Fix Build Errors
- If build passes: Proceed to commit phase
- If build fails: Analyze and fix errors iteratively
- Maximum 5 rebuild attempts
- Apply additional dangling pointer fixes as needed

### 6. Commit Changes

#### 6.1. Commit Confirmation
Ask user to confirm whether to commit changes

#### 6.2. Once User Confirms
- Execute `git add -u` to add tracked changed files
- Execute `git commit -m '${commit_description}'` with descriptive message
- Push changes to repository

## Dangling Pointer Fix Patterns

### Pattern 1: Incorrect Destruction Order (25%)
```cpp
// Before: Wrong member order
class MyClass {
  raw_ptr<Dependency> dependency_;  // Destroyed first
  std::unique_ptr<Owner> owner_;    // Destroyed second - creates dangling pointer
};

// After: Correct member order  
class MyClass {
  std::unique_ptr<Owner> owner_;    // Destroyed second
  raw_ptr<Dependency> dependency_;  // Destroyed first - safe
};
```

### Pattern 2: Observer Callback (4%)
```cpp
// Before: Observer doesn't clear pointer
void Observer::OnObjectDestroyed() {
  // pointer_ still points to deleted object
}

// After: Clear pointer on destruction
void Observer::OnObjectDestroyed() {
  pointer_ = nullptr;
}
```

### Pattern 3: Smart Pointer Conversion (14.6%)
```cpp
// Before: Manual memory management
raw_ptr<Object> object_;
// Later: delete object_; // Creates dangling pointer

// After: Smart pointer management
std::unique_ptr<Object> object_;
// Automatic cleanup, no dangling pointer
```

### Pattern 4: WeakPtr Usage (3.13%)
```cpp
// Before: Raw pointer to potentially deleted object
raw_ptr<LongLivedObject> object_;

// After: WeakPtr for safe non-owning reference
base::WeakPtr<LongLivedObject> object_;
```

## Emergency Procedures

**When immediate landing is required:**
- Use `DanglingUntriaged` annotation with clear test case documentation
- Provide reproduction steps and affected component information
- File P2 bug for future resolution

**When architectural fix isn't feasible:**
- Use `DisableDanglingPtrDetection` with comprehensive safety justification
- Document why the pointer can never be dereferenced after becoming dangling
- Ensure long-term maintainability and safety

## Quality Assurance

**Every fix must:**
- Address the root cause, not just symptoms
- Follow established Edge coding standards
- Include appropriate test coverage
- Build successfully on target platforms
- Maintain existing functionality
- Include clear documentation of changes

**Validation steps:**
- Run dangling pointer detector builds
- Execute relevant unit and integration tests
- Verify no new dangling pointer issues introduced
- Confirm proper destruction order and lifecycle management

Remember: The goal is not just to eliminate dangling pointer warnings, but to improve code safety, maintainability, and architectural clarity while preserving all existing functionality.
